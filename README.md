# Python Basic----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This program goes into the very basics of python. This includes 
        - Print: using variables 1-3, print values, casting, and get type
   
        - Multi-Variables: using variables 4-13, Multi-Line string, string array, many values to many variables, one value to many variables, and unpacking a list
    
        - String: using variables 14-21, String length, check if a letter/word is in the sentence or not, String slice at start/end/negative index, Capitalize/Lower case a string, Remove spaces at beginning and end, Split String, Replace letters in a string, String format, having quotes in a string 
    
        - Math/Numbers: using variables 22-31 | import math/random, shows int, float, scientific number, complex numbers (Imaginary), random numbers, finding the min and max values, Adding a power to something, Squaring something, Ceil - rounding up, Floor - rounding down
    
        - Boolean: REUSING variables 18 and 20, explains how a boolean works, basically a true or false
    
        - Date: using variables 33-34 | import datetime, shows how to set a date, weekdays, months, local date/time, and month as a number
    
        - Def Functions: using variable 32, explains how a function works, value inside the def vs outside the def is different
    
        - User Input: shows how to let the user give an input

# ADD LATER Python Functions---------------------------------------------------------------------
    This program
        - Lists: 

        - Tuples:  
        
        - Sets:  
        
        - Dictionaries:  
        
        - If/Else:  
        
        - While Loops: 
        
        - For Loops:  
        
        - Functions:  
        
        - Lambda: 
        
        - Arrays:  
        
        - Try/Except:

# Python Classes---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This program goes into a few class related functions
        - Classes/Object: Create a class/object, __init__() function = MyClass1, Object Method = MyClass2, Modify object properties, delete object 
        
        - Inheritance: create an inheritance of parent and child class = MyClass3, puts variables in parent and child class 
        
        - Iterator: Created a string iterator which goes through each letter, created Loop string iterator, Created a tuple iterator which goes through each word, created loop tuple iterator, Created a class/object itertor that would only loop until 5 and then stops
        
        - Scope: Local scope, calls function within a function, global scope > go back to python basic function for understanding, global keyword to make variable global

# Python Tkinter----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This program opens a GUI in tinker that explains Labels, Buttons, Entry, Check boxes, Radio boxes, Drop-Down boxes, (and new windows) in their own def. Each window size besides main is 600x600. Quit button will terminate GUI.
    
        - Labels: Creating a label and explaing how grid works. Pack shoves the code onto the screen and automatically resizes. Grid will let you organize more, but will not resize.

        - Buttons: Creating a button, how to use state to disable a button, make a button a wacky size using padx/pady, how to make a button have an action using def, changed color of font/button within the button.
            NOTE: mybut9 and mybut10 variable are used in Entry.

        - Entry: Creating an entry, making the entry background a color, creating a border width, def Entry get will return output, Entry insert will insert text within the entry box already
    
        - Check Boxs: Creating a check box, created variables for amount of boxes, def isChecked shows variable output
    
        - Radio Buttons: Creating a radio button, created a variable (1) for radio variables, def radioClick shows what you selected
    
        - Drop-Down Buttons: Creating a drop-down box, created a variable (1) for dropbox to remember your input, set dropbox to value
